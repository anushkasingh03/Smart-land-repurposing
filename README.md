# TerraNova â€” Smart Land Repurposing

### Overview
TerraNova is an ongoing research project focused on **AI-driven land recovery and post-wildfire analysis**.  
Our goal is to build a system that can analyze satellite or aerial images to **detect burn severity**, **evaluate environmental impact**, and **suggest suitable land recovery strategies**.  

This repository will hold all the code, data, and experiments as we develop and test different machine learning approaches for image segmentation and environmental analysis.
